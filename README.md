# Employee-Data-System
Tracks Employee data from a file
To assist in the analysis the organization has provided a data file from their time reporting system.  
The file contains the employee ID, department an employee works in, billable time, and administrative support time.
Each of the time fields are in hours with a quarter of an hour being the smallest increment. 
 For example 2 hours and 15 minutes would appear as 2.25 on the file.
